## Liferay Chatbot NPM React Portlet "Ask Ray"

This is a chatbot integrated to DialogFlow Google's NLP engine. There are two versions of the chatbot both in my GitHub. This one is an NPM Portlet with React and ChartJS dependencies. You can have a conversation with it and it will draw a simple graph using ChartJS below. Ask it "How can I create a blog" by either typing or literally speaking to it.

There is a Liferay Service and API which is required as a dependency. This service just records the chat history in Liferay. You need to build and deploy the service and chatbot module.
